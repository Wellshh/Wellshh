Iâ€™m a third-year Computer Science undergraduate at Southern University of Science and Technology, currently on exchange at The University of Sydney. My main focus: learning, understanding, and changing the world (one line of code at a time). Iâ€™m exploring the intersection of AI and philosophyâ€”trying to drag us all, kicking and screaming, out of Platoâ€™s cave. That includes philosophers, machines, and myself.

Building on that focus, my interests lie in cybersecurityâ€”specifically within machine learning architecture. Iâ€™m especially drawn to federated learning and how to ensure security and data privacy in distributed systems. Iâ€™m also working on accelerating inference for MLLMs (Multi Large Language Models)â€”optimizing architectures and analyzing inference workflows to reduce computational overhead, boost efficiency, and, just maybe, uncover a unified way to encode (and understand) multimodal information.
